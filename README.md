# Cheap_SJ

The goal is to check the SJ website (swedish trains) for the cheapest tickets from Uppsala to any destination on a certain date (chosen by the user)

The first step is automating the search for journeys and the second step is collecting the ticket prices for all trips and ranking them from lowest to highest.

## To run it
I'm using python 3.
Install selenium, bs4 and lxml:
```
pip3 install selenium
pip3 install bs4
pip3 install lxml
```
To run the program:
```
python3 sj_filler.py
```
